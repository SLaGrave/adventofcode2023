# Advent of Code 2023

[Sam LaGrave](https://github.com/SLaGrave)'s Advent of Code (2023) submissions.

## Plan

The plan is to do each day twice - once in python (for speed/point maximization) and once in rust (to practice rust). We'll see how long this plan holds up.

## Days completed

- **Day 01**
  - :white_check_mark: Python
  - :white_check_mark: Rust
- **Day 02**
  - :white_check_mark: Python
  - :white_check_mark: Rust
- **Day 03**
  - ⚠️ Note: I added an extra NoOp to each row to make parsing a bit easier
  - :white_check_mark: Python
  - :white_check_mark: Rust
- **Day 04**
  - ⚠️ Note: I edited the input format manually to make parsing easier
  - :white_check_mark: Python
  - :white_check_mark: Rust
- **Day 05**
  - ⚠️ Note: Heavily edited input
  - ⚠️ Note: I originally really hated my implementation, but looking back on it the day after writting it I really don't think it's that bad (slow as all hell though)
  - :white_check_mark: Python
  - :x: Rust - Doubt it honestly...
