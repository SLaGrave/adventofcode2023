# Advent of Code 2023

[Sam LaGrave](https://github.com/SLaGrave)'s Advent of Code (2023) submissions.

## Plan

The plan is to do each day twice - once in python (for speed/point maximization) and once in rust (to practice rust). We'll see how long this plan holds up.

## Days completed

<details>
<summary>Days 1-5</summary>

- **Day 01**
  - :white_check_mark: [Python](./day01/python/)
  - :white_check_mark: [Rust](./day01/rust/)
- **Day 02**
  - :white_check_mark: [Python](./day02/python/)
  - :white_check_mark: [Rust](./day02/rust/)
- **Day 03**
  - ⚠️ Note: I added an extra NoOp to each row to make parsing a bit easier
  - :white_check_mark: [Python](./day03/python/)
  - :white_check_mark: [Rust](./day03/rust/)
- **Day 04**
  - ⚠️ Note: I edited the input format manually to make parsing easier
  - :white_check_mark: [Python](./day04/python/)
  - :white_check_mark: [Rust](./day04/rust/)
- **Day 05**
  - ⚠️ Note: Heavily edited input
  - ⚠️ Note: I originally really hated my implementation, but looking back on it the day after writting it I really don't think it's that bad (slow as all hell though)
  - :white_check_mark: [Python](./day05/python/)
  - :x: Rust

  - :white_check_mark: [Python](./day07/python/)
  - :x: Rust
- **Day 08**
  - ⚠️ Note: Edited the input format slightly

- **Day 09**
  - :white_check_mark: [Python](./day09/python/)

</details>

- **Day 11**
  - :white_check_mark: [Python](./day11/python/) - ⚠️ HELLA SCUFFED! Part one can be simplified to work like part two... might do that later...
  - :x: Rust
- **Day 12**
  - :white_check_mark: [Python](./day12/python/) - ⚠️ Got a bit of help from the subreddit here, so the code is sort of hard to follow for part 2 as its a combo of my usual scuffed style + a different way of looking at the recursion for part 2.
